# Stochastic-Input-Transformation
A stochastic input pre-processing technique based on a process of down-sampling/up-sampling using convolution and transposed convolution layers. Defending convolutional neural network against adversarial attacks.


Implementation of our proposed defense strategy against adversarial attacks "Defensive Approximation (DA)"

A Pytorch code for our [paper](https://ieeexplore.ieee.org/document/9422778). It includes the implementation of our defense startegy named "SIT: Stochastic Input Transformation to Defend Against Adversarial Attacks on Deep Neural Networks"
